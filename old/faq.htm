                <h2>How can I use your service?</h2>
                <ol>
                	<li>Register with Global by simply completing our Registration Form and faxing back it to us. For Money Laundering
                    Regulations proof of identification will be required.</li>
                    <li>A Senior Trader will call you to discuss your ongoing currency requirements and advise on current rates.</li>
                    <li>When you make a transaction a Deal Ticket confirming the details will be sent advising you where to remit your funds
                    and requesting the final recipient bank details.</li>
                    <li>After remitting your funds to our segregated Barclays Client account, Global will convert the funds into your chosen
                    currency, and send to the destination notified.</li>

                <br />
                <h2>How long does it take for my funds to reach my foreign bank account?</h2>
                Once we have cleared funds (allow 5 working days for a cheque, 2/3 days for a BACS transfer and instantly for a CHAPS
                transfer) your chosen foreign currency will be immediately transferred and should reach your designated bank account
                within 1 to 5 working days.
                <br />
                <h2>Will my funds be secure?</h2>
                Authorised Payment Institutions, such as Global, are required to safeguard client funds held in relation to an electronic
                payment. Global also have to meet stringent criteria, set by the FSA, in terms of corporate governance, solvency risk
                identification and management. Global is fully authorised by the FSA to provide payment services as an Authorised
                Payment Institution (PI).<br />
                You can search the list of FSA authorised payment service companies at

                <h2>How do you manage to beat the banks?</h2>
                We monitor a range of treasury providers to secure the most competitive exchange rates in the market. In addition we
                have a high turnover, with low fixed costs and overheads, allowing us to pass the considerable savings generated directly
                onto you, the client.
                <br />
                <h2>Are the rates guaranteed?</h2>
                Yes. We give actual exchange rates prevalent at that specific time rather than indication rates provided by other sources
                such as internet sites and teletext.
                <br />
                <h2>How much does it cost to use your service?</h2>
                Nothing as there are no fees to register, no commissions and no telegraphic transfer costs.
                <br />
                <h2>How do I get my money to you?</h2>
                You can send us a cheque, or if you need money transferred quickly, you can use a CHAPS or BACS payment method
                from your bank direct to our segregated Barclays Client account.
